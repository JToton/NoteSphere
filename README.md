13. NOTE: ChatGPT was only used to assist in creating dialog for the README file. The OpenAI software was not used to assist in any code generation, HTML edits, CSS edits or otherwise any of the assets located within the repository other than this README specifically. The software was used to assist in creating a professional README.md file that would meet standards within the industry (to the best of my knowledge). Additionally, school resources, linked within the citations already, were used in combination to flush out the design.

14. All other links, sources and information gained and used within the project were found or otherwise located within the above sources(sublinks within the above links). The classwork, modules, TA's, as well as the instructor provided a multitude of links within the assignment itself as well as within class demonstrations and our communication through slack and or discord.
